# Exploring-Weather-Trends
 Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends 


# Summary
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.


# Instructions
My goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

Extract the data from the database. 
Writeing a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
Writeing a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

# The Database Schema
There are three tables in the database:

city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
